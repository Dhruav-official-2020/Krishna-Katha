1.krsna says that he is neither in his supreme abode , neither in the heart of a meditating devotee , but he is where his pure devotees are singing and dancing
2.the definiion of love is given next,  that love is not just about taking but also about offering only taking and not giving is not love it is exploitation , 
3. to krsna we can offer our love in form of chanting singing dancing and engaging in the devotional services of the lord , 
4.one should submit to the lord and pray to the lord that "o lord i have been tossing in the material ocean please pick me up" ,  
5.one's focus should always be to get out of this material mire and not try to control the tossings of the oceans because it is a foolishness to do that as tossings in  the ocean  will anyway come and go
6.what is actual religion ? religion's ultimate aim is to connect with God or Krsna . if it is not then  it is not a religion . BG is also a religion as many of the great saints have accepted it as a supreme 
   principle of relligion and and krsna as the supreme presonality of Godhead .
7. despite of this many of them do not accept BG and they have no faith , so the have no connection to  krsna , 
8. in this material world it is no guarantee that one would be born in india or america or some other planet in the next life  , so there is no guarantee about his or her spiritual initiation 
9.so one must practice KC to get out of all this ..   
10.yudhshtra maharaja once told that the most  wonderful thing in the world is - "Every one is dying Each second , entering into the temple of death but yet evryone is thinking that He/She will live for 
 and keep the material opuleneces with him/her" 
11.this is the darkest illusion under which lives and suffer  ,  this is a very high risk  life and the death is actually simply waiting for us ,
at that time no intelligence not bodily strenght does not work in saving us  , 
at that time the prakritih gives us a new  body according to spiritual and material activities 
BUT if one leaves the body thinking of Krsna goes to GOLOK VRINDAVAN the supreme Abode which is independent of Space and time ,
if a devotee is unable to remember Krsna due to the Pain (400000 scorpions biting at the same time ) , then Krsna helps him making him remember.  ;)
