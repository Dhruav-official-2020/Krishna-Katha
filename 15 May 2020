1.) the ninth chapter of BG is for the devotees of lord / for them who have under stood that the Krsna is BHAGWAN
2.) one who has too much of pride and ego and has not accepted Sri Krsna as the suprreme personality of Godhead will think that all this is just  a mere  exaggeration , but they don't know even the highest 
    exaggeration cannot describe Krsna
3.)Krsna says that it is him <krsna> who has cretated everything that we are seeing , but it is not to be supposed that after doing all this manfestations he has retired no it is not so , 
    as one starts a factory but does not get retired by making this factory , 
4) all the material and spiritual worlds rest in him .
5.)but it is also to be known that , everything animate  and inanimate  is resting over krsna but krsna is independent of all of them , that is krsna and his energy(material world + spiritual world) 
     are indifferent wrt the qualties of krsna (as a drop from a salty ocean ) but they are not equal or same,
6.)as the sunshine is has the qualities of the sun (heat and light) , but it is not the sun itself.
7.) all the  material and spiritual energies are of him, but the energy is dependent on krsna but not the opposite is true ,
