1.)there are 2 types of energies of krsna  -  material and spiritual , we/ jiva-atmas are the part of the spiritual energy but as we are prone to be attracted to the material energy ,so we are also called the
    marginal energy of krsna ,  
2.)the atheists who are envious of krsna do not accept krsna's oplences, even when they read BG ,and Krsna say's : "I am God" ,they also say the same, but when they are asked to show their universal 
    form , they cannot show that , 
3.) the difference b/w psuedo God and Real God is that of the Past times of Krsna -  He Had 16108 wives all in different palaces , now these atheists cannot keep their one wife properly ,
4.)the atheists say that "Ooh it is just your believes" , but they do not know that it is the full and complete belief and surrender that invokes lord's mercy and he provodes the intelligence to understand his 
  message 
5.)the atheist also ask a silly quesion that- "if god can do any thing then can he make a stone that he himself cannot lift" - the aim of the atheists is that of some how critisizing God but the actual answer
  to this question is - "Yes Krsna can make a stone that he can't lift but after that he will lift it" - "Krsna will make the stone"  ->  just for satisfying the jiva-atma <atheist> as he uncnditionally loves each and every
  jiva-atma BUT "Krsna will lift it up" for the Devotees because he also loves them unconditionally - also lifting up of stone will also destroy the Ego within the atheist and do good to him , and also give 
  him a reason to love and serve God..
