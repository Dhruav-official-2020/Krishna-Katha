1.)the scientists think that the whole nature is runing by itself , but krsna says in the BG - "mayadhyakshena prakritih suyate sa characharam hetnaneya Kaunteya jagad vipartate" all the material nature is
   is working under the direction of Krsna - the whole manifestation is formed and anhiliated again and  again in him <krsna> ,
2.)as a good machine can be very well manufactured by a manufacturer but it cannot work without  a man's touch, similarly bramha can make the whole material manifesation, but the life/seed giving father is 
always Krsna 
3.)one may think that Krsna would feel like Atlas <greek god lifting the whole earth with a lot of endevour>  but Krsna Says in BG - although all beings are resting on krsna's energy but all the but they are 
  not resting on krsna , krsna is everywhere , he is mantaining each and every atom of the material creation  , 
4.)people often complain that they can't see Krsna anywhere , but  as an electritian can use the electrical energy but a lay man cannot , similarly us , if we are transcendentally situated we  can see God everywhere ,
Hari-bol
